Description: This package implements functions to estimate the phenotypic variance explained by a set of genetic effects,
    interaction effects or jointly by genetic and interaction effects. It only uses summary statistics
    and is designed for meta-analyses by computing phenotype and exposure moments in the pooled sample
    of individual cohorts.
