\title{Calculate the mean and variance of a quantitative variable in a pooled sample 
of several cohorts}
\usage{
calculateContParams(N, m, v)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{is a vector of sample size in each cohorts}

\item{m}{is a vector of the mean of the variable in each individual cohort}

\item{v}{is a vector of the standard deviation of the variable in each 
individual cohorts}
}
\value{
A vector of length 2 which first element is the mean and 
  second element is the variance
}
