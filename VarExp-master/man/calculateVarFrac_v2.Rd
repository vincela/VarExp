\title{Calculate the fraction of phenotypic variance explained by as set of 
significant genetic effect and/or interaction effects.}
\usage{
calculateVarFrac_v2(std_bG, std_bI, matcor, varY, N, type)
}
\arguments{
\item{std_bG}{is the vector of standardized genetic effect sizes}

\item{std_bI}{is the vector of standardized interaction effect sizes}

\item{matcor}{is the genotype correlation matrix}

\item{varY}{is the phenotypic variance in the pooled sample}

\item{N}{is the total sample size}

\item{type}{indicates wether only genetic or interactions effects should be 
considered or if both should be considered jointly.}
}
\value{
The fraction of phenotypic variance explained by user-specified effects.
}
\description{
This version takes into account potential rank deficiencies
in the correlation matrix and noise in the  effect size estimation.
